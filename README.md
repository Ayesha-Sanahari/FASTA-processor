# FASTA-processor
This Python program includes classes and methods to process sequences given in the FASTA format


• A method to split multiple FASTA sequences in a single file to several FASTA files.

• A method to count the number of FASTA sequences in a file containing multiple sequences.

• A method to combine individual FASTA files into a single FASTA file.

• A method to remove unwanted/unknown characters from a FASTA nucleotide sequence.

• A method to remove unwanted/unknown characters from a FASTA amino acid sequence.

• A method to calculate and append the length of an input FASTA sequence to the respective FASTA header.

• A method to calculate and append the length of each sequence to the respective FASTA header for a given input file containing multiple FASTA sequences.

• Methods to calculate AT content in DNA and RNA sequences.

• Methods to calculate GC content in DNA and RNA sequences.

• A method to calculate and append the AT or GC content of an input FASTA sequence and append it to the FASTA header. The FASTA sequence, sequence type, and content type (AT or GC) should be the input parameters for the method.

• A method to calculate and append the AT or GC content for each sequence in a multiple sequence FASTA file, and append it to the FASTA header. The FASTA sequence, sequence type, and content type (AT or GC) should be the input parameters for the method.
